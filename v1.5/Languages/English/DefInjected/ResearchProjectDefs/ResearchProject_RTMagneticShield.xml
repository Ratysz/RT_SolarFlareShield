	<ResearchProject_RTMagneticShield.description>Allows construction of a magnetic shield that protects electronic devices against electromagnetic interference, including that caused by solar flares.

When idle, the shield requires a pittance of power to maintain it's detection circuits, ever ready to activate whenever interference front approaches. Should that happen, the shield will start drawing up to 25 kWt of power in order to form a semblance of localized magnetosphere, neutralizing the effect that the interference would have on colony's electronics. Effective range of this protection is enough to cover the colony and then some.

Even reduced by the shield, excessive electromagnetic fluctuations will still render more sensitive devices like comms consoles inoperable.</ResearchProject_RTMagneticShield.description>
